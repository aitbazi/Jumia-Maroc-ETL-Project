# 🛍️ Jumia Maroc ETL Project (Web Scraping + Talend)

This project is a beginner-friendly **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built to extract product data from [Jumia Maroc](https://www.jumia.ma), clean it, and load it into structured formats using both **Python** and **Talend Open Studio**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Learn the full ETL process using **real-world data**
- ✅ Practice **web scraping** with Python
- ✅ Use **Talend** to manage data transformation and loading
- ✅ Train decision-making skills by planning and organizing a complete data pipeline

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

- **Python** – for web scraping and initial data extraction  
- **BeautifulSoup / requests** – to parse HTML pages  
- **Pandas** – for transformation and cleaning  
- **Talend Open Studio** – to build and run the ETL pipeline  
- **CSV / Excel** – for storing the cleaned data  

---

## 🧩 Project Structure

1. **Web Scraping**  
   Use Python to extract product names and prices from a Jumia category page.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   Format the prices, remove unnecessary data, and prepare a clean dataset using Pandas or Talend components like `tMap`, `tFilterRow`, etc.

3. **Loading the Data**  
   Load the cleaned data into:
   - CSV or Excel file
   - (Optional) MySQL or another database

4. **Talend Integration**  
   Replicate the transformation and loading steps using Talend Jobs to automate and visualize the ETL process.
